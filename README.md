# CIVE202_Spring2026_Group5_Project-2

## Project Overview 

This project was completed for the course Civil Engineering Analysis II at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
The objective of the project is to migrate an excisting concrete mix design model from an Excel-based workflow to a Python-based system. Our client for this project is NDOT (Nebraska Department of Transportation). They would like us to replicate and automate the logic of the "Mix Design" worksheet so that the user can enter material properties and automatically generate the weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete.

The project involves:
- Translation of the Excel logic into Python code. All major calculations should be clearly defined and replicated in Python.
- Implement sequential user inputs.The inputs should be collected in logical order and mirror the Excel worksheet.
- Generate a final mix design. Python program must produce a clearly formatted weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete.

The final output includes a scope of work (SOW), a formal document defining the tasks our group unertook to automate the NDOT Model. A gantt chart providing a visual project schedule. For python code, a jupyter notebook documenting the automation logic, the sequential user prompts, and the four mix runs. Fully operational and executable without errors. As well as an annotated code document (ACD) explaning said pyhton code. Lastly, a written techinical report, including background on NDOT project, methods, results, and refrences.

## Respository Structure 
The respository is organized as follows:

-`mix-design-submittal.xlsx/`
  Excel workbook including calculation sheets and formulas used to determine mix proportions based on the user inputs for the requirments and quantities. 
  
-`CIVE 202_Spring 2026_Group 5_Project #2.ipynb/`
 Includes all Python scripts used for calculations. Transalted and organized in similar to the Excel workbook. 

-`Annotated Page/`
 Includes a line-by-line explanation of code. With specific explanation of how the Excel formulas were converted into Python functions.

-`results/`
 Contains Gantt Chart results. 

-`CIVE 202_Spring 2026_Group 5_Project #2_SOW/`
 Contains Scope of Work outlining project's goals and defines the tasks to automate the NDOT model.

-`Final report/`
   Contains detailed report on the background of the NDOT project and objectives. Detailed explanations of methods used to excel function conversions to python code. As well as results on the four chosen mix designs, highlighting diffences in results. And refrences to NDOT or other refrences used. 

-`READ.md`
 Documentation and user guide for this project.
